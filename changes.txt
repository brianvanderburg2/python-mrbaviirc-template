Unreleased
==========

Changed
-------

* Parser changes will require some template changes. In particular expression
  sections may now require a semicolon separator to define more information
  such as on include between the path expression, with and return segments
  or on code segments

* Currently dot notation only performs attribute lookup and bracket notation
  performs item lookup.  Eventually a change may be added to allow

  . notation (item, then attr)
  [ ] notation (always item)
  @ notation (always attr)

  data = user.name (first try user["name"] then user.name
  data = user["name"]  - always user["name"]
  data = user@name - always user.name

* Code formatting changes

Added
-----

* New parser supports more natural operators such as +, -, ==, /, <, >

* Parser allows tail continuations

    users[0].name.toupper()[0] - Access user[0], attribute/item name, call
    toupper on name, the access the first item/character of the result

* Hook tag allows calling registered hooks.

    Hooks can be registered that take env, template, renderer, scope, and params
    Tags of {% hook ... ; with ... %} and {% rhook ... ; with ... %} can then
    be used to call the hooks.  The call just returns if the hook doesn't exist.
    Hooks may be used to generate output directly with renderer, include other
    templates via env, template.render_nested, set variables in the scope, etc.

* Userdata can be passed to a template during render.

    Userdata passed can then be passed on to hooks and in the future special
    functions. These hooks and functions can then access the userdata.
